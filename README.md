Databases Projects

📍 **NIAT Hyderabad** | 🎓 *1st Year Student*

As part of my learning journey in database systems, I designed and implemented a **Research Projects Database** to efficiently manage data related to projects, employees, and funding agencies.

This involved designing a complete **Entity-Relationship (ER) schema** and writing **SQL statements** to create and populate tables with real-world relationships like project assignments, managers, and funding links.
